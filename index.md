## Shachar Mirkin's home page

I'm a Natural Language Processing researcher at [Digimind](https://www.digimind.com/fr/) Labs in Grenoble, France.

In 2012, I completed my PhD studies at the [NLP lab](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~nlp/) at Bar-Ilan University. My PhD thesis, in Natural Language Processing, addressed topics in textual entailment and was done under the instruction of [Prof. Ido Dagan](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/). 

Following graduation I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Xerox Research in France and at the University of Grenoble, mostly on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and then in Project Debater at IBM Research AI.
