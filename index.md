I am an freelance applied researcher with 20+ years of hands-on expertise in NLP, AI,
machine learning, and data science, spanning industry and academia.

I have worked in startups and corporations, successfully bringing AI projects from design to production across domains, including legal, finance, and healthcare/biomedical. I have nearly 10
years of experience as a manager and team leader (6+ years in data science),
co-supervising graduate students and mentoring interns and junior colleagues.

I hold a PhD in Computer Science specializing in NLP, have completed 3Â½ years of postdoctoral research, and published multiple patents and academic articles (~35 papers, 3500+ citations, h-index: 21) at top-tier venues, [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsEZbOkAAAAJ&hl=en)).

I'm based in France and open for remote projects as a freelancer. <a href="contact.html">Contact me</a> to hear more.

Among the many tasks I've worked on over the years are information extraction, machine translation, sentiment analysis, object detection, location classification, automatic punctuation, and text classification over various types of texts, including spoken and user-generated data. I've employed various approaches, from rules and classic machine learning to deep learning, including large language models.
