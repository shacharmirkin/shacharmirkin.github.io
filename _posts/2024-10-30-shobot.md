We wanted to experiment with a low-budget mobile robot with machine-learning (ML) capabilities. We decided on a project in which the robot's mission is to detect when someone enters the house wearing shoes, and respond accordingly, helping maintain a shoe-free space! The robot uses ML to distinguish between two categories: shoes (forbidden) and bare feet, socks, or slippers (allowed).

On this [Github repo](https://github.com/ofirmirkin/Shoebot/) we describe in detail the projectâ€™s key components and the challenges we encountered along the way. The full code and a sample dataset are also available in our repo.
