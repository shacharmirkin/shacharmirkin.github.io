When I saw that Lichess openings dataset was shared on Hugging Face, I thought Iâ€™d use AI to create an app within 45 minutes (like everyone else says they do) to help my daughter practice openings.

Since my front-end skills are quite limited, Cursor was crucial, but I ended up spending much more time than planned, frequently consulting various LLMs, fixing code myself and reverting changes quite often (lesson learned: when using such tools, commit all the time!)

The result is a little [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app for practicing chess openings, and my first project where AI wrote more code than I did.

You can try it here (completely free of course): https://huggingface.co/spaces/shachar/chess-openings

The code is also available there
